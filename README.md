# Arduino-Based-Heart-Monitor

This repository hosts the source code and design files for a wearable heart monitoring system built using Arduino Uno, heart rate, and temperature sensors. The system gathers body temperature, heart rate, and SpO2 data, which can be accessed via an Android app connected through Bluetooth. The wearable device aims to provide real-time health monitoring for users.
